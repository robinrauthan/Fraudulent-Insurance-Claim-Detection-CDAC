# Fraudulent-Insurance-Claim-Detection-CDAC
## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a Fraudulent Insurance Claim Detection project. The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an insurance claim is fraudulent or not based on various features. The project involves data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Fraudulent Insurance Claim Data." It contains various features related to insurance claims, including policy information and incident details. The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify potentially fraudulent claims.
